# Balatro AP Mod

This is a Mod for [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) that provides Integration for [Arichpelago Multi World](https://archipelago.gg)

# Requirements

Needs [Steamodded (Alpha)](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install-the-alpha). Just follow the installation instructions there (yes, you will need to install lovely). 

After installing that, you will also have to download the [lua apclient](https://github.com/black-sliver/lua-apclientpp/releases). There you need to download the `lua51.7z` and extract the file `lua51-clang64-dynamic > lua-apclientpp.dll` and put it into your Balatro installation folder (the same folder you put the lovely dll). 
![Your Balatro Folder should look something like this (highlighted files should be there)](https://i.imgur.com/Pe5uTX4.png).

# Installation

To install this mod create a new folder in `%AppData%/Roaming/Balatro/Mods/` called `BalatroAP` and put the files from this repository in there. ![Your AppData Folder should look something like this](https://i.imgur.com/3JzrdlV.png).

You should be good to go then! If there are any issues, consider going to the Archipelago After Dark Discord server, there is a Balatro thread somewhere. Or message me on Discord @Burndi. 

# Connecting

In Balatro you can simply connect by selecting the profile "Archipelago" in the profile selector. 
If you have a save file from a different AP session (so an entirely different mutliworld) you should delete the old save. 
It is adviced that you backup your existing save files, even though they should not be modified or deleted by this mod.
